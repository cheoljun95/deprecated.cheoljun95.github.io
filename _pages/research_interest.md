- **Engineering Intelligence** <br>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> I believe one of the best way of understanding something is to build it. With recent burst of the field of AI, I have been fascinated in AI, especially in the artificial neural network. This led me to be engrossed in several projects in related field: natural language processing, computer vision and robotics. </p>

- **Human Mind** <br>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> Human mind is the most sophisticated machine with intelligence. I believe investigating the underlying process of human mind will lead to better understanding of general intelligence. I am mainly focused on computational approach, rigorously applying machine learning techniques. </p>

- **Computational Neuroscience** <br>
<p style='text-align: justify;'> Research on human subject has limitation to study low-level mechanism. So I am also interested in the field of computational neuroscience to investigate the fundamental basis of intelligence. </p>
