About Me
======
Hi, I am an undergraduate student in department of Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University. My interest lies on a broad prespective of intelligence: natural intelligence, human mind and artificial intelligence.

Research Interest
======



- Engineering Intelligence 
I believe one of the best way of understanding something is to build it. With recent burst of the field of AI, I have been fascinated in AI, especially in the artificial neural network. This led me to be engrossed in several projects in related field: natural language processing, computer vision and robotics.
