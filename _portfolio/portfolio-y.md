This project was conducted as a part of Creative Integrated Design Course in Seoul National University, which aims to provide opportunities to participate in university-industry projects. I was involved in developing a plant disease detection system & web application as a team of four. Our team collaborated with LG Farm Hannong, the biggest agricultural company in South Korea, under supervision of Prof. Yeong-Gil Shin, SNU. <\p>
