This project was conducted as a part of 2018 Fall Creative Integrated Design Course in Seoul National University, which aimed to provide opportunities to participate in university-industry projects. I was involved in developing a plant disease detection system & web application as a team of four. Our team collaborated with LG Farm Hannong, the biggest agricultural company in South Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Yeong-Gil Shin, SNU. 

The plant disease detection was tackled by the image classification problem by categorizing the pathological degree of each disease (e.g. unaffected/early/terminal marssonia blotch). As the dataset provided from Farm Hannong was limited, we also used public plant disease dataset from PlantVillage ([1] Hughes et al, 2016) to facilitate transfer learning.
