I participated in 2020 Creative Desgin Fair as a team of four. 2020 Creative Desgin Fair was a competition held by the college of Engineering in Seoul National University, where participating teams competed with creativity and ability to implement. Our team implemented an Interactive Robotic Vacuum with a novel shape & locomotion. My role was implementing the algorithm for the automatic control, and implementing the smartphone application for human-robot interaction (HRI). I was also heavily involved in building the robot body from scratch. <br><br>
